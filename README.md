While online and offline competitive gaming is not a new phenomenon, the majority of gamers were considered amateurs until recently. That is until the 2000s, when both the number of professional players and fans experienced a significant surge, widely due to newer game genres, mass media attention, and online streaming technology. 
Even in India Esports has bloomed just recently but not enough, this was the main driving force behind building Game Vamp.
